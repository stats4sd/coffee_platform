        The State of the Coffee Smallholder Platform is an open access data resource for smallholder coffee farmers and different actors working with coffee smallholders who are using data for decision-making. The platform results from an extensive review, analysis and synthesis of existing data and information about coffee smallholders in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Honduras. We have described the data collection process and key findings in detail in the <a href={{ url('/reports') }} style="color:blue;">report</a> .
    </p>

        The platform and the accompanied report complement other initiatives that – in various ways - seek to gather, synthesize, and analyze social, economic, and/or environmental data about coffee smallholders. While many initiatives focus on tracking and documenting coffee industry actors’ sustainability efforts, our approach is from the bottom up. Based on the available data, we are taking steps toward drawing a more holistic picture about coffee smallholders, their livelihoods, and the challenges they are facing. We are also seeking to identify data gaps, and vision how we could improve data collection and sharing among a variety of actors along the coffee value chain, including the farmers and their organizations.
