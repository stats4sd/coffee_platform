        Smallholder coffee farmers are essential to the ever-growing coffee industry, and help to protect and provide vital ecosystem services. However, declining coffee prices have left farmers with narrower profit margins, causing significant impacts on farmer households, communities, and cooperatives.  Numerous case studies – conducted by organizations, institutions, and scholars – have sought to document ‘the state of smallholder coffee farmers’ in terms of economic, social, and environmental factors. Yet, very few reports have been able to comprehensively and collaboratively capture trends at the farm, national or regional level. In addition, there is a challenge in making the information and synthesis available to relevant actors in the supply chain. To date, most of the data and analyses available, either stays in academic papers that are not friendly or accessible to most actors, or as reports that are not released to the public.

        The State of the Coffee Smallholder Platform is a multi-stakeholder open-sourced data resource for smallholder coffee farmers and the different actors working with them. Recognizing the lack of accessible information pertaining to smallholder farmers, the project team has initiated an extensive review, analysis and synthesis of the conditions and contributions of smallholder farmers at origin - all of which have ripple effects on the whole coffee sector. This information is expected to be critical in fuelling necessary conversations in the sector and improve data-driven decision making while reducing data collection and processing burdens.
